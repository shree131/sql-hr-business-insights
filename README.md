# HR & Business Insights with SQL

This project contains ad-hoc SQL analyses designed with deliverables that demonstrate proficiency in **SQL view creation**, **multi-table joins**, **conditional logic**, **aggregation**, and **business-aligned data modeling**.


### Key Highlights

* **HR & Salary Insights**
  Created views to:

  * Track current salaries of department managers
  * Compare manager salaries against department averages
  * Aggregate average salaries by department
  * Prepare cost optimization insights by summarizing current salaries across departments

* **Customer Segmentation by Rental Behavior**
  Built views to:

  * Calculate movie return durations and customer-specific average return times
  * Categorize customers as *Good*, *Fair*, or *Bad* based on their return habits
  * Generate a customer dashboard-ready view for marketing and retention analysis

* **Business Valuation Metrics**
  Designed aggregated views to:

  * Calculate average rental duration per customer
  * Measure DVD rental volume and customer count by district
  * Create a valuation summary report for regional business performance

* **Cost Analysis for Labor Optimization**

  * Isolated current salary obligations based on active contracts
  * Combined department assignments to assess departmental labor costs
